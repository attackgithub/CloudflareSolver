Cloudflare JavaScript & ReCaptchaV2 challenge solving library (aka. *Under Attack Mode* bypass).

*Inspired by [CloudFlareUtilities
](https://github.com/elcattivo/CloudFlareUtilities)*

## Requirements

* This library is compiled with .NET Standard 1.3. Check full implementation support [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard)
* To use the ReCaptchaV2 solver you must create an account on [2Captcha](http://2captcha.com/?from=6591885)

## Download

* https://github.com/Zaczero/CloudflareSolver/releases/latest

## Getting started

```cs
// If you do not want to use the ReCaptchaV2 solver simply remove the parameter
var cf = new CloudflareSolver("YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY");

var httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpClientHandler);
var uri = new Uri("https://uam.zaczero.pl/");

var result = cf.Solve(httpClient, httpClientHandler, uri).Result;
if (result.Success)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"[Success] Protection bypassed: {result.DetectResult.Protection}");
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine($"[Failed] Details: {result.FailReason}");
	return;
}

// Once the protection has been bypassed we can use that httpClient to send the requests as usual
var response = httpClient.GetAsync(uri).Result;
var html = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;

Console.WriteLine($"Server response: {html}");
```
